# BoldTween
Tweening library built on top of Unity's open-source UI namespace.

## Installation
Download and unzip into your project.

Works best with:
* [BoldEditor](https://github.com/ophilbinbriscoe/BoldEditor) (nicer inspector)
* [BoldEvent](https://github.com/ophilbinbriscoe/BoldEvent) (extended functionality)

### Projeny
[Projeny](https://github.com/modesttree/Projeny) is an excellent dependency management solution for Unity. While it is not required, all of the ToBoldlyPlay packages were designed with a Projeny workflow in mind.

If you are finding the Projeny documentation a bit daunting, see the following issue for a more detailed guide on getting Projeny up and running: https://github.com/modesttree/Projeny/issues/8.
